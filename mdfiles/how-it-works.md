# How It Works

## 1. Set Up a Scan for Your Desired Campground

The first step involves figuring out what campground you want to set up a scan for to find availabilities. There are a lot of rules at these campgrounds, especially regarding number of cars, guests, and length of trailers / RV's. You are responsible for making sure the campsite is suitable. 

By using our scanner, we will walk you through selecing only the campgrounds and campsites that fit your speicifc requirements.

## 2. Wait for an Alert for an Open Site

Once a new campsite becomes available that fits your criteria, we will email you and send you a text. It's important that you act as quickly as possible once you get an alert.

## 3. Book Your Campsite

Click on the link in the email or text we send you and click through to Reserve California. Navigate to Reserve California and go to your desired campsites and dates you were notified for and book it!

## 4. Time to Go Camping!

Now all you need to do is wait for your dates and have fun camping :)
