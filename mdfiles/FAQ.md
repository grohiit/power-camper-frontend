# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do you sell campsites?

No, PowerCamper doesn't hold an inventory of campsites, or scalp reservations. We simply search for and alert you to last minute cancellations.

## Do you have an availability for X campground on Y date?

You can manually check ReserveCalifornia for immediate availability. Powercamper is set up to look for cancellations over a range of dates, to find you opportunities to book at sold-out campgrounds.

## How do I set up a scan on Powercamper?

We have a walkthrough guide on setting up a scan here - https://www.powercamper.com/faq/scan-setup

## Why does the site have a monthly subscription? I don't camp every month!

We have to keep the total number of people receiving these instant notifications low, so that you have a chance to get in there and reserve the site. If we sent an alert to 1000 people everytime a weekend reservation popped up, there would be 1 happy subscriber and 999 unhappy ones. That is not a sustainable business model. 

## Can I cancel my subscription for months that I do not plan to camp?

Yes, cancel anytime, but there are no refunds. The minimum term of service is one month, which you pay for on inital sign up. If you wish to terminate the subscription simply use the "unsubscribe" link in your Edit Profile Details page here. This will prevent the next month's payment from being automatically deducted. Your service will then stop at the end of the current subscription period.

## What campgrounds do you cover?

Right now, we are focused on Southern California beach campgrounds as they are extremely popular and hard to get reservations at. However, we are looking to expand our campground database and will be expanding into other states soon!
